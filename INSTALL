If you want to install in a virtualenv, create one:

    virtualenv venv -p /usr/bin/python3

And activate it:

    . venv/bin/activate

You'll need:
    -   Python3
    -   Google Protobuf for python.
        python3 -m pip install protobuf
    -   Jack client: http://jackclient-python.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.3/#installation
        python3 -m pip install JACK-client
    -   Install spug libraries for python.
    -   Alsa headers and libraries: (`apt-get install libasound2-dev` on
        debian-derived systems)

And for development:
    -   pylint3:
            sudo apt-get install -t jessie-backports pylint3

        You need the jessie-backports version of this, debian latest has
        failed dependencies.

Then in this directory, build awbd:

    make

and build and install all of the python stuff:

    python3 setup.py install
